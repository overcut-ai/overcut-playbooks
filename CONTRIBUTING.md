## 📝 Playbook Structure Guidelines

Each playbook must follow this structure:

```
playbook-name/
├── workflow.json          # Complete workflow definition
├── README.md              # Following the standard template
├── step-1-description.md  # Prompt for each step
├── step-2-description.md
├── special agents/        # (Optional) Specialized agent instructions
│   └── agent-name.md
└── ...
```

### Special Agents Folder

Use the `special agents/` folder when your workflow requires **specialized agents with domain-specific expertise** that go beyond generic roles.

**When to use:**

- ✅ Specialized roles requiring specific domain knowledge (e.g., Security Engineer for CVE analysis)
- ✅ Agents needing detailed behavioral guidelines or decision frameworks
- ✅ Custom agent personas that are unique to this workflow

**When NOT to use:**

- ❌ Generic roles like "Backend Developer", "Frontend Developer", "Code Reviewer"
- ❌ Agents that work fine with default Overcut agent configurations
- ❌ Simple delegation without specialized expertise

**Example:**

```
remediate-cves/
├── workflow.json
├── README.md
├── analyze-cve-and-plan.md
├── post-remediation-plan.md
└── special agents/
    └── security-engineer-agent.md  # Specialized CVE analysis expertise
```

The `special agents/` folder contains detailed instructions for configuring specialized agents in Overcut, including:

- Role identity and expertise areas
- Key principles and behavioral guidelines
- Decision frameworks specific to the domain
- Examples of good analysis patterns

### README Template

Use this structure for consistency:

```markdown
# [Workflow Name]

## 📋 Overview

[2-3 sentences about what it does and outputs]

## ⚡ Triggers

[Automatic and manual triggers]

## 🎯 Use Cases

[When to use this workflow]

## 🔧 Prerequisites

[Required setup]

## 🏗️ Workflow Steps

[Step-by-step breakdown]

## 🎨 Customization

## 🚀 Submission Process

### For New Playbooks

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/overcut/overcut-playbooks.git
   cd overcut-playbooks
   git checkout -b add-playbook-[your-playbook-name]
   ```

2. **Create your playbook folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir [playbook-name]
   cd [playbook-name]
   ```

3. **Add required files**

   - `workflow.json` - Export from Overcut or create manually
   - `README.md` - Using the template above
   - `step-*.md` - One file per workflow step

4. **Test your workflow**

   - Import into Overcut
   - Run on test data
   - Verify outputs are correct
   - Document any edge cases

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Clear title: "Add [Playbook Name] workflow"
   - Description of what the workflow does
   - Screenshots or examples (if helpful)
   - Link to any related issues

### For Improvements

1. **Open an issue first** (optional but recommended)

   - Describe the improvement
   - Get feedback before investing time

2. **Make your changes**

   - Update relevant files
   - Keep changes focused and atomic
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Reference any related issues
   - Explain the improvement
   - Include before/after examples if applicable

## ✅ Quality Standards

### Workflow Files

- ✅ Valid JSON syntax
- ✅ Complete step definitions
- ✅ Clear step names and descriptions
- ✅ Appropriate timeout values
- ✅ Tested and working

### Prompts

- ✅ Clear, specific instructions
- ✅ Include examples when helpful
- ✅ Handle error cases
- ✅ Specify output format requirements
- ✅ Pass complete context between steps

### Documentation

- ✅ Grammar and spelling checked
- ✅ Code examples are accurate
- ✅ All sections completed
- ✅ Customization guide included
- ✅ Prerequisites clearly stated

### Special Agents (if applicable)

- ✅ Instructions placed in `special agents/` folder
- ✅ Only used for specialized domain expertise (not generic roles)
- ✅ Clear role identity and expertise areas documented
- ✅ Key principles and decision frameworks included
- ✅ Examples provided where helpful

### Naming Conventions

**CRITICAL**: Prompt filenames must match step IDs in `workflow.json`

- Folder names: `lowercase-with-hyphens`
- Prompt files: `{step-id}.md` (e.g., `prepare-review-plan.md` for step with `id: "prepare-review-plan"`)
- **NOT**: `step-1-name.md` or numbered files
- Clear, descriptive names (not too long)

#### Why This Matters

When prompt filenames match workflow step IDs, AI agents can:

- Automatically identify which step a prompt belongs to
- Update the workflow.json when a prompt is edited
- Maintain consistency between prompts and workflows
- Enable bidirectional editing (prompt ↔ workflow)

## 📝 Working with AI Agents

### Example AI Workflow

```
User: "I edited code-review.md to focus more on security. Update the workflow."

AI:
1. Reads code-review.md
2. Finds step with id "code-review" in workflow.json
3. Replaces instruction field with new content
4. Saves workflow.json

```

## 🔒 Agent IDs and Sensitive Data

**Important**: When sharing workflows, remember:

- Agent IDs in `workflow.json` are organization-specific. They will be replaced with the actual agent IDs when the workflow is imported into Overcut.
- Never include API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Sanitize any organization-specific information
- Remove any internal repository references
