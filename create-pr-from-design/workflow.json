Read the requirements and design described in the triggering issue and comments.\n2. Follow the conversation on the issue and comments and make sure to use the latest approved requirements and design as reference.\n3. Your plan should be focus on the functional changes only. Do not include any changes to tests, documentation, or other non-functional changes.\n4. Follow the project's architecture and coding standards strictly. Review similar implementations in the repo before planning. Look for common patterns, directory structure, service boundaries, and existing extension points.\n5. Do not introduce new packages, libraries, or external dependencies unless explicitly requested.\n6. If you believe such an addition is required, mark it as \"new dependency\" in your plan.\n7. Do not include in your plan any changes to non-functional files like tests, documentation, or other non-functional changes.\n8. Do not write code. Your task is to create a plan for the next agent to implement.\n9. The implementation plan must be broken into sequential phases.\n   • Each phase should contain small tasks that can be executed independently.  \n   • The plan should be easy to track across phases.\n10. Return the final plan so the next agent can implement it.\n\n---\n\n### Example Implementation Plan\n\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\n\n# Implementation Plan\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal of this implementation plan is to introduce a new user preferences update endpoint that integrates cleanly with existing controllers, services, and repository layers while preserving the project architecture and ensuring only functional changes are applied.\n\n## Phase 1 - Add API Endpoint\n\n1. Create a new controller method under `src/controllers/userPreferences.controller.ts` to handle updating user preferences.\n2. Add a new route entry in `src/routes/userPreferences.routes.ts` pointing to the new controller method.\n3. Reuse the existing validation pattern seen in `src/controllers/profile.controller.ts` to validate the incoming payload.\n4. Ensure the controller method delegates logic to the service layer without adding business logic inside the controller.\n\n## Phase 2 - Implement Service Logic\n\n1. Add a new method `updateUserPreferences` in `src/services/userPreferences.service.ts`.\n2. Follow the pattern used in the `profile.service.ts` update method for data fetching and persistence.\n3. Ensure the service loads the current user record and applies only the fields defined in the requirements.\n4. Return a normalized DTO object consistent with existing service returns.\n\n## Phase 3 - Repository and Data Layer Updates\n\n1. Add a new repository method in `src/repositories/user.repository.ts` for saving updated preference fields.\n2. Follow naming conventions used in `src/repositories/profile.repository.ts`.\n3. Confirm that only the required fields are persisted and no unrelated data is modified.\n\n## Phase 4 - Wire Up Dependency Configuration\n\n1. Register the new service and repository references in the project dependency container in `src/config/container.ts`.\n2. Follow the same pattern used for profile and settings components.\n   \\`\\`\\`\n",

This provides immediate visibility and a single entry point for monitoring implementation progress.\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n\n- An approved design document exists in the issue or comments\n- Implementation plan has been created in the previous step\n- Repository has been cloned\n\n## Inputs\n\nFrom the triggering issue and previous steps:\n\n- `issue_url`: URL of the triggering issue\n- `issue_title`: Title of the issue\n- `implementation_plan`: The implementation plan from the previous step.\n\n## Overall Process\n\n1. Pull the latest changes from origin for the current branch.\n\n2. Create a new implementation branch:\n   - Branch name: `prbuilder/<slug>` where slug is derived from the issue title\n   - Create from the current branch (the cloned branch)\n   - Verify branch creation succeeded\n\n3. Parse the implementation plan to extract:\n   - Overall goal\n   - All phases and their tasks\n   - Expected changes and scope\n\n4. Create a **draft pull request**:\n   - Check if a PR already exists for this branch, if it does, update it\n   - Title: `[DRAFT] <issue_title>`\n   - Body: Initial description (use template below)\n   - Mark as **draft** \n   - Base branch: The branch that was cloned\n   - This PR will be updated with progress in the next steps\n\n5. Post a comment on the triggering issue:\n   - Include link to the draft PR\n   - Note that implementation is starting\n   - Mention that progress can be monitored in the PR\n\n6.

This PR will be updated with:\n\n- Progress tracking with checkboxes for each phase\n- Commits for each completed phase\n- Test results and validation\n- Final review-ready status\n\n## Branch Information\n\n- **Implementation Branch**: `prbuilder/<slug>`\n- **Base Branch**: <base_branch_name>\n- **Merge Target**: Base branch (the branch that was cloned)\n\nThis description will be updated with full details once implementation begins.\n\n---\n\n_This is a draft PR. Progress can be monitored in real-time._\n```\n\n---\n\n## Issue Comment Template\n\nPost this comment on the triggering issue:\n\n```markdown\n## 🚀 Implementation Started\n\n**Branch**: `prbuilder/<slug>`\n**Draft PR**: <draft_pr_url>\n\nImplementation is now in progress. You can monitor real-time progress in the draft PR above.\n\nThe implementation will follow the plan created in the previous step and will be committed in phases.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nWhen the workflow completes successfully, you MUST output the following information:\n\n```\nbranch_name: prbuilder/<slug>\ndraft_pr_url: <URL to the draft PR>\nbase_branch: <base_branch_name>\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```\nbranch_name: prbuilder/add-user-preferences-endpoint\ndraft_pr_url: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456\nbase_branch: main\n```\n\n---\n\n## Coordinator Behavior Rules\n\n• Pull latest changes before creating branch.\n• Create implementation branch with clear naming: `prbuilder/<slug>`.\n• Branch from the cloned branch.\n• Create draft PR with the cloned branch as base.\n• Use the Initial Draft PR Description template - keep it simple and plan-focused.\n• Post comment on triggering issue with link to draft PR.\n• Output all required information for the next step.\n• Do NOT implement any code - that's the next step's responsibility.\n• Verify branch and PR creation succeeded before completing.\n\n\nImplementation Plan:\n{{outputs.planning}}",

Collect all information from previous steps:\n\n   - Implementation summary with all phases (from implement-changes step)\n   - Validation summary with test and lint results (from validate-implementation step)\n\n2. Update the draft PR description with comprehensive final details.\n\n3. Convert the draft PR to \"Ready for Review\":\n\n   - Mark the PR as ready (remove draft status)\n   - Update PR title to remove [DRAFT] prefix\n\n4. Update the triggering issue:\n   - Post completion comment with PR link and summary\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 - Update PR Description\n\nUpdate the existing draft PR description with comprehensive final details.\n\n**PR Description Template**:\n\n```markdown\n# <issue_title>\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR implements <issue_title> based on the approved design document.\n\n**Issue**: <issue_url>\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\n<Include the implementation summary from previous step, organized by phase>\n\n### Phase 1: <phase_title>\n\n- <summary of changes>\n- Commit: <commit_sha>\n\n### Phase 2: <phase_title>\n\n- <summary of changes>\n- Commit: <commit_sha>\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ Comprehensive tests written for all new functionality\n- ✅ All tests passing\n- ✅ Test coverage meets project standards\n\n## Validation\n\n- ✅ Lint checks passed\n- ✅ Format checks passed\n- ✅ Code quality verified\n\n## Files Changed\n\n- **Total Commits**: <N>\n- **Implementation Commits**: <N>\n- **Test Commit**: 1\n- **Validation Commit**: 1\n\n## Review Notes\n\n<Any specific notes for reviewers based on the implementation>\n\n---\n\n_Implementation complete and ready for review._\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 - Convert to Ready for Review\n\nUpdate the PR:\n\n1. **Update PR title**: Remove [DRAFT] prefix\n\n   - Before: `[DRAFT] Add user preferences endpoint`\n   - After: `Add user preferences endpoint`\n\n2. **Mark as ready**: Convert from draft to ready for review\n   - This signals to reviewers that implementation is complete\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 - Update Issue\n\nPost a comment on the triggering issue:\n\n```markdown\n## ✅ Implementation Complete\n\n**Pull Request**: <pr_url>\n\nImplementation is complete and ready for review.\n\n### Summary\n\n<Brief summary of what was implemented>\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- **Phases Completed**: <N>\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage added\n- **Validation**: All lint and format checks passed\n- **Branch**: `<branch_name>`\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Review**: Review the pull request for code quality and correctness\n2. **Test**: Test the implementation in appropriate environment\n3. **Merge**: Merge to base branch when approved\n\nThe PR includes a complete implementation with tests and validation.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Output Requirements\n\nWhen the workflow completes, output:\n\n```markdown\n# Finalization Complete\n\n## PR Details\n\n- **PR URL**: <pr_url>\n- **Status**: Ready for Review\n- **Branch**: <branch_name>\n\n## Summary\n\n- Implementation: <N> phases completed\n- Tests: Added and passing\n- Validation: Passed\n- Status: Ready for review\n\n## Commits\n\n- Implementation commits: <N>\n- Test commit: 1\n- Validation commit: 1\n- Total commits: <N>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Coordinator Behavior Rules\n\n• Collect implementation summary from implement-changes step.\n• Collect validation summary from validate-implementation step.\n• Update the existing draft PR description with comprehensive final details.\n• Convert draft PR to \"Ready for Review\" (remove draft status).\n• Update PR title to remove [DRAFT] prefix.\n• Post completion comment on the triggering issue.\n• Provide detailed output with all commit information.\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThis step is successful when:\n\n- ✅ Draft PR is converted to ready for review\n- ✅ PR title updated (no [DRAFT] prefix)\n- ✅ PR description is comprehensive with implementation and validation details\n- ✅ Triggering issue updated with completion comment\n- ✅ PR is ready for code review",
