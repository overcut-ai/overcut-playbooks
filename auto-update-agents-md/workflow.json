Your goal is to analyze the repository structure and extract patterns, best practices, and information needed to generate comprehensive AGENTS.md documentation for AI agents working with this repository.\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Step 1: Scan Repository Structure\n\n1. **List repository directories and files:**\n\n   - Scan the repository root for directories and files (excluding hidden files and special directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, etc.)\n   - Identify the overall repository structure and organization\n   - Note the types of files and directories present (code, workflows, documentation, configs, etc.)\n   - Create a map of the repository structure\n\n2. **Read existing AGENTS.md (Use as Reference for Analysis):**\n   - Read the current `AGENTS.md` file (if it exists) to understand:\n     - The repository's documented structure and organization\n     - The repository's conventions and patterns as described\n     - The types of content and sections that are relevant\n     - The documentation approach used\n   - Note the existing structure, style, and format for reference (these will be preserved in the next step)\n   - Identify what content appears to be static vs dynamic based on the analysis\n   - Use this file to better understand the repository context and what should be documented\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Repository Patterns\n\nBased on what exists in the repository:\n\n1. **If code files are present:**\n\n   - Identify the programming languages used\n   - Note the code organization structure (modules, packages, components, etc.)\n   - Identify common patterns and conventions\n   - Note build systems and tooling (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)\n   - Identify testing patterns and structures\n\n2. **If documentation is present:**\n\n   - Read README.md files to understand project structure\n   - Note documentation patterns and conventions\n   - Identify documentation organization\n\n3. **Analyze configuration files:**\n   - Identify configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.)\n   - Note common configuration patterns\n   - Identify tooling and dependencies\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Extract Common Patterns\n\nBased on all repository content analyzed, identify:\n\n1. **Structure Patterns:**\n\n   - Common directory organization\n   - File naming conventions\n   - Common file types and their purposes\n   - Standard locations for different file types\n\n2. **Code Patterns (if code exists):**\n\n   - Common code organization patterns\n   - Naming conventions\n   - Testing patterns\n   - Build and deployment patterns\n\n3. **Documentation Patterns:**\n\n   - README structure patterns\n   - Documentation conventions\n   - Common instruction patterns\n   - Output format requirements\n\n4. **Best Practices:**\n   - Quality standards observed\n   - Common validation patterns\n   - Error handling approaches\n   - Edge case handling\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Identify Reference Examples\n\nIdentify items that serve as good examples for:\n\n- **Simple structures**: Minimal or straightforward examples\n- **Complex structures**: More sophisticated examples\n- **Different types**: Various patterns and approaches\n- **Common patterns**: Frequently used structures\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compile Analysis Results\n\nCreate a structured analysis output containing:\n\n1. **Repository Statistics:**\n\n   - Repository type (workflows, codebase, mixed, etc.)\n   - Key directories and their purposes\n   - Common file patterns\n   - Technologies and tools used\n\n2. **Structure Patterns:**\n\n   - Directory organization\n   - File naming conventions\n   - Common file types\n\n3. **Code Patterns (if applicable):**\n\n   - Code organization\n   - Common patterns and conventions\n   - Testing approaches\n\n4. **Documentation Patterns:**\n\n   - Documentation structure\n   - Common patterns\n   - Conventions\n\n5. **Reference Examples:**\n\n   - Examples by category\n   - Items demonstrating specific patterns\n\n6. **Current AGENTS.md Reference (if exists):**\n   - Document the existing structure, style, and format for reference\n   - Note what sections exist and their organization\n   - Identify what appears to be static vs dynamic content\n   - This information will be used by the next step to preserve the existing documentation\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Output Analysis\n\nUse the `task_completed` tool to complete the analysis.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n\nWhen the step completes, you MUST output the following information in a structured format:\n\n```\nanalysis_complete: yes\nrepository_type: <workflows|codebase|mixed|other>\nkey_structures: <list of key directories/structures>\npatterns_found: <summary of key patterns>\ntechnologies: <list of technologies/tools identified>\nreference_examples: <list of example items by category>\n```\n\n**Example outputs:**\n\n**For a codebase repository:**\n\n```\nanalysis_complete: yes\nrepository_type: codebase\nkey_structures: [\"src/\", \"tests/\", \"docs/\"]\npatterns_found: \"Common patterns: module-based organization, test-driven structure, API conventions\"\ntechnologies: [\"Python\", \"pytest\", \"FastAPI\"]\nreference_examples: \"Simple: basic-module, Complex: full-feature-module\"\n```\n\n**If analysis fails:**\n\n```\nanalysis_complete: no\nerror: <error description>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n- **Be thorough**: Analyze all relevant parts of the repository\n- **Be accurate**: Extract exact patterns, don't generalize incorrectly\n- **Be structured**: Organize findings in a way that's useful for documentation generation\n- **Be adaptive**: Adjust analysis based on what the repository contains\n- **Handle errors**: If parts have issues, note them but continue analysis\n- **Preserve context**: Keep track of where each pattern comes from\n- **Use existing documentation as reference**: If AGENTS.md exists, use it to understand the repository context and documentation approach\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Empty repository**: Report minimal structure, still analyze existing AGENTS.md\n- **Unusual structure**: Note the structure but continue analysis\n- **Missing files**: Note missing expected files but continue\n- **AGENTS.md doesn't exist**: Note this, will need to generate from scratch\n- **Large repository**: Focus on key patterns, summarize similar structures\n- **Mixed repository types**: Analyze all types present\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- The analysis should be comprehensive but efficient\n- Focus on patterns that are useful for documentation\n- Don't extract sensitive data (agent IDs should be generic references, no API keys, etc.)\n- Adapt the analysis depth based on repository size and complexity\n- The goal is to understand the repository well enough to generate helpful AGENTS.md content\n- If AGENTS.md exists, use it as a reference to understand the repository's documented structure and conventions\n",

Only write the file to the disk. Committing and PR creation are handled by subsequent steps.**\n\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Step 1: Receive Analysis Data\n\n**Previous step output:**\n\n```\n{{outputs.analyze-repo.message}}\n```\n\nThe previous step provides:\n\n- Repository type and structure\n- Key structures and patterns found\n- Technologies and tools identified\n- Reference examples by category\n- Current AGENTS.md structure analysis (if exists)\n\n**Action:**\n\n1. Parse the analysis data from the previous step\n2. Extract key information needed for documentation generation\n3. Understand the repository type and structure\n4. If analysis failed, generate minimal documentation structure and stop\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Read Current AGENTS.md (If Exists)\n\n1. **Read the existing AGENTS.md file:**\n\n   - Read the current `AGENTS.md` file from the repository root (if it exists)\n   - Get the complete content\n   - Understand the existing structure, sections, and organization\n   - Note the documentation style, format, and conventions used\n\n2. **If AGENTS.md doesn't exist:**\n\n   - Proceed to Step 3 to create a new file\n   - Skip comparison steps\n\n3. **If AGENTS.md exists:**\n   - Proceed to Step 3 to compare and determine if updates are needed\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine What Needs Updating\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: Only make changes when necessary. Avoid unnecessary changes that would create PRs for no reason.**\n\nCompare the analysis data with the existing AGENTS.md (if it exists) to determine what needs updating:\n\n1. **Check for factual changes:**\n\n   - Are there new patterns discovered that should be documented?\n   - Are there outdated examples that need updating?\n   - Are there missing critical information that should be added?\n   - Are there factual errors that need correction?\n   - Have repository structures changed significantly?\n\n2. **Check for content updates needed:**\n\n   - Reference examples \u2192 update if repository structure changed\n   - Common patterns \u2192 update if new patterns discovered\n   - Structure examples \u2192 update if repository organization changed\n   - Statistics and counts \u2192 update if numbers changed\n   - Technology lists \u2192 update if technologies changed\n\n3. **Decide if changes are needed:**\n   - **If no significant changes**: Preserve the existing file as-is, output `changes_made: no`\n   - **If changes are needed**: Proceed to Step 4 to generate updated content\n   - **Avoid changes for:**\n     - Style improvements\n     - Reorganizations that aren't necessary\n     - Clarity improvements that aren't needed\n     - Formatting changes unless there are errors\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Generate or Update Content\n\n**If AGENTS.md doesn't exist:**\n\n1. **Create new AGENTS.md structure:**\n   - Build comprehensive documentation based on repository analysis\n   - Include sections appropriate for the repository type\n   - Use standard documentation patterns\n   - Follow the file format guidelines (see separate section below)\n\n**If AGENTS.md exists and changes are needed:**\n\n1. **Update existing content:**\n\n   - Start with the existing file as the base\n   - Keep the existing structure, style, and format\n   - Make only the necessary updates identified in Step 3\n   - Preserve section order and hierarchy\n   - Maintain existing writing style and tone\n   - Keep existing formatting conventions\n\n2. **Update specific sections:**\n   - Update only sections that need factual changes\n   - Keep sections that are still accurate as-is\n   - Add new sections only if critical information is missing\n   - Remove sections only if they're factually incorrect\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Write AGENTS.md File\n\n1. **Write the content to `AGENTS.md`:**\n\n   - Write the generated/updated content to the repository root\n   - Ensure the file is written successfully\n   - Verify the file exists and has content\n\n2. **Verify content:**\n   - Check file exists and has content\n   - Verify markdown syntax is valid\n   - Ensure file size is reasonable\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL NOTE: Do NOT commit the changes.** The file should be updated in the repository, but NEVER run git commit or git push. This is a strict restriction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Output Results\n\nUse the `task_completed` tool to complete the task.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n\nWhen the step completes, you MUST output the following information:\n\n```\nchanges_made: <yes|no>\nfile_path: AGENTS.md\n```\n\n**Example outputs:**\n\n**If file was created or updated:**\n\n```\nchanges_made: yes\nfile_path: AGENTS.md\n```\n\n**If file exists and no changes were needed:**\n\n```\nchanges_made: no\nfile_path: AGENTS.md\n```\n\n**If generation failed:**\n\n```\nchanges_made: no\nfile_path: AGENTS.md\nerror: <error description>\n```\n\n---\n\n## AGENTS.md File Format Guidelines\n\nWhen creating or updating AGENTS.md, follow these format guidelines:\n\n### Structure\n\nThe file should include sections appropriate for the repository type:\n\n1. **Project Overview**\n\n   - Repository purpose and description\n   - Key technologies and tools\n   - Repository type and structure\n\n2. **Repository Structure**\n\n   - Directory organization\n   - File naming conventions\n   - Common file types and their purposes\n\n3. **Development Guidelines**\n\n   - Best practices\n   - Common patterns and conventions\n   - Organization principles\n\n4. **Code Patterns** (if code exists)\n\n   - Code organization patterns\n   - Naming conventions\n   - Testing patterns\n   - Build and deployment patterns\n\n5. **Quality Standards**\n\n   - File requirements\n   - Documentation requirements\n   - Validation patterns\n\n6. **Critical Rules**\n\n   - Important constraints and requirements\n   - Key principles\n\n7. **Common Tasks**\n\n   - Step-by-step guides for frequent operations\n   - Examples and patterns\n\n8. **Reference Examples**\n\n   - Examples by category\n   - Items demonstrating specific patterns\n\n9. **Additional Resources**\n   - Links to relevant resources\n   - Documentation references\n\n### Formatting\n\n- Use proper markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)\n- Use code blocks with language tags for code examples\n- Use code blocks without language tags for file structures\n- Maintain consistent spacing\n- Use proper list formatting\n- Use emoji in section headers if appropriate (\ud83d\udccb, \u26a1, \ud83c\udfaf, etc.)\n\n### Content Guidelines\n\n- Be accurate: Only include items that actually exist in the repository\n- Be comprehensive: Include all relevant patterns and examples\n- Be clear: Use clear, concise language\n- Be specific: Provide concrete examples\n- Be up-to-date: Reflect current repository state\n\n---\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n- **Make changes only when needed**: Update content when there are actual changes in the repository or factual errors\n- **Avoid unnecessary changes**: Don't make style improvements, reorganizations, or clarity changes that aren't needed\n- **Preserve existing structure**: Keep section order and hierarchy when updating existing files\n- **Preserve existing style**: Maintain writing style and tone when updating existing files\n- **Preserve existing format**: Keep markdown formatting conventions when updating existing files\n- **Update when necessary**: Update examples, counts, patterns, and references when they're outdated or incorrect\n- **Avoid PRs for no reason**: If content is still accurate and up-to-date, preserve it as-is\n- **Be accurate**: Only include items that actually exist in the repository\n- **Be comprehensive**: Include all relevant patterns and examples\n- **Validate examples**: Ensure code examples are syntactically correct\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **AGENTS.md doesn't exist**: Generate complete file from scratch based on repository analysis\n- **Analysis data incomplete**: Use available data, note missing information\n- **Empty repository**: Generate minimal structure with placeholders\n- **Unusual repository structure**: Document what exists, adapt to structure\n- **File write fails**: Report error, don't proceed to commit step\n- **No changes needed**: Preserve existing file, output `changes_made: no`\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- The generated/updated AGENTS.md should be ready for the next step (commit)\n- All markdown should be properly formatted\n- Code examples should be valid\n- Reference examples should link to actual repository items\n- The goal is to keep documentation up-to-date while avoiding unnecessary changes\n- Do NOT commit changes - that's handled by the next step\n- Focus on factual accuracy and completeness, not style improvements\n",

You MUST output the following:\n\n```\nsignificant_changes: <yes|no>\nreview_summary: <Briefly explain why you kept or discarded the changes>\n```\n\n**Quality Guidelines:**\n- Be a strict gatekeeper. It is better to skip an update than to spam the user with \"Documentation: fixed typo\" PRs.\n- Always check the actual `git diff` to avoid hallucinations.\n- Ensure the repo is left in a clean state if changes are discarded.\n",

Include brief summary of what was updated (if significant changes)\n   - Keep message concise but informative\n\n   **Example commit message:**\n\n   ```\n   docs: update AGENTS.md\n\n   - Updated reference examples with current repository structure\n   - Added new patterns discovered in repository analysis\n   - Updated common patterns section with latest practices\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the commit:**\n   - Commit the staged changes\n   - Use the generated commit message\n   - Verify commit was created successfully\n   - Get the commit SHA\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Push Branch\n\n1. **Push the branch to remote:**\n\n   - Push the new branch to the remote repository\n   - Verify push was successful\n\n2. **Handle push errors:**\n   - If push fails (e.g., permission issues, network problems):\n     - Report the error\n     - Note that commit was created locally but not pushed\n     - Don't fail the workflow, but report the issue\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Create Pull Request\n\n1. **Generate PR title:**\n\n   - Create a descriptive PR title\n   - Format: `docs: Update AGENTS.md`\n   - Keep it concise and clear\n\n2. **Generate PR description:**\n\n   - Create a descriptive PR description\n   - Include:\n     - Brief summary of what was updated\n     - List of key changes made\n     - Why the changes were needed\n   - Keep description informative but concise\n\n   **Example PR description:**\n\n   ```\n   ## Summary\n\n   This PR updates AGENTS.md with the latest repository structure and patterns.\n\n   ## Changes\n\n   - Updated reference examples to reflect current repository state\n   - Added new patterns discovered in repository analysis\n   - Updated common patterns section with latest practices\n   - Updated statistics and counts\n\n   ## Why\n\n   This update ensures AGENTS.md stays synchronized with the current repository structure and best practices.\n   ```\n\n3. **Create the pull request:**\n   - Create PR from the new branch to the default branch (main/master)\n   - Use the generated title and description\n   - Verify PR was created successfully\n   - Get the PR number and URL\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Output Results\n\nUse the `task_completed` tool to complete the task.\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n\nWhen the workflow completes, you MUST output the following information:\n\n```\nchanges_committed: <yes|no>\npr_created: <yes|no>\nbranch_name: <branch name if created, null otherwise>\npr_number: <PR number if created, null otherwise>\npr_url: <PR URL if created, null otherwise>\n```\n\n**Example outputs:**\n\n**If PR was created successfully:**\n\n```\nchanges_committed: yes\npr_created: yes\nbranch_name: update-agents-md-20250120\npr_number: 123\npr_url: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123\n```\n\n**If no changes were detected:**\n\n```\nchanges_committed: no\npr_created: no\nbranch_name: null\npr_number: null\npr_url: null\nreason: no_changes_detected\n```\n\n**If commit created but PR creation failed:**\n\n```\nchanges_committed: yes\npr_created: no\nbranch_name: update-agents-md-20250120\npr_number: null\npr_url: null\nerror: <error description>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Guidelines\n\n- **Only commit if changes were made**: Don't create commits or PRs if no changes were detected\n- **Descriptive messages**: Use clear, informative commit messages and PR descriptions\n- **Handle errors gracefully**: Report errors but don't fail workflow unnecessarily\n- **Verify operations**: Check that git operations succeeded before proceeding\n- **Preserve history**: Don't force push or rewrite history\n\n---\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **No changes detected**: Skip all operations, report success\n- **File doesn't exist**: Report error, don't proceed\n- **Git not configured**: Report error, note configuration needed\n- **Not in git repo**: Report error, note repository issue\n- **Branch creation fails**: Report error, note the issue\n- **Commit fails**: Report error, note the issue\n- **Push fails**: Report error, note that commit exists locally\n- **PR creation fails**: Report error, note that branch and commit exist\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- The commit should be made to a new branch, not directly to main/master\n- Don't create merge commits or force pushes\n- Keep commit messages and PR descriptions professional and descriptive\n- Verify all git operations succeeded before proceeding\n- If PR creation fails, the branch and commit still exist and can be used to create PR manually\n- Always create PRs to the default branch (main/master)\n",
